# Some basic knowledge about Python.

## What is Python?
Python is a dynamically typed , interactive , object-oriented programming language designed by Guido van Rossum. 

### What is the meaning of *'dynamically typed'*?
This means variables in this type of language don't need to declare type .

### What is the meaning of *'interactive'*?
Which means you can receive timely feedback when you finish your program without compiling.

### What is the meaning of *'object-oriented'*?
Differ from Process-oriented.
In this kind of programming language , you don't need to design every steps of your project in the first time. But to finish every part of the project and connect them together at last .
So , the advantage is you can use the 'part' repeatedly and the disadvantage is the running speed will slow down .

### What is the diffenrence between *32-bit operating system* and *64-bit prerating system*?

If you choose 32-bit operating system , then the maximum addressing is 2 to the 32nd power , which equals to 4294967296 . And transmitting it into memory is 4294967296/1024/1024/1024 = 4 (GB) .

But if you choose 64-bit operating system , then the maximum addressing is 2 to the 64th power , which equals to 1.844674407371e+19 . And transmitting it into memory is nearly  infinity.

So if your computer is 32-bit operating system ,  the memory more than 4 (GB) will be useless. But the 64-bit operating system has no limits.

### What is the diffence between *Absolute path* and *Relative path* ?

The absolute path refers to the path where the file actually exists on the hard disk. And the Relative path refers to position relative to one's goal.
