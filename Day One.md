## Notes
1. We use # to note single line.
2. We use ''' ''' or """ """ to note multi-line.

## Show your result on the screen
We use the 'print' function to display the date , text or symbol from your program.

``` 
print(12) 
print("Hello world")
print("#")   
```

Differ from the language C , you can use the 'print' function more smartly.

```
 print(1+2)  print(2*2)  print(6/2)
 print("Hello world" , "Hello Terry")
 print("#"*6)   print("10 + 8 =",18)
```

## Type your value to the program
We use the 'input' function to give the value artificially. And keep the value in the variables.

```
age = input(" 请输入您的年龄：")
print("your age is " , age)

```
